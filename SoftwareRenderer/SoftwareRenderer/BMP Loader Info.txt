This bitmap loader was taken from http://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie1330/bmploader.html
I needed a bitmap loader for textures so this was suitable.
I have used it as a foundation and then implemented my own modifications to the loading in
my texture manager which holds it.
I made a few modifications to the file such as namespacing however that was all.
